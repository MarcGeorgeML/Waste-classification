##  Overview

<p>‚ùØ This repository is focused on developing a waste classification system, primarily leveraging deep learning techniques in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The project is designed to help classify images of various waste types to promote efficient waste management and recycling.

Key Components:

- Dataset Integration:
The repository includes compressed dataset files (e.g., TrashType_Image_Dataset.zip and archive.zip) containing images of different waste types. These datasets form the foundation for training and evaluating the classification model.

- Model Development Notebook:
The model.ipynb notebook serves as the central hub for data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation. It provides a step-by-step workflow for implementing a deep learning model to classify waste images.

- Environment and Dependencies:
The requirements.txt file lists the necessary Python libraries and dependencies, ensuring that the project can be set up and run consistently. The setup.py may be used for packaging or further environment configuration.

- Python and Jupyter-based Implementation:
The project is implemented primarily using Python within a Jupyter Notebook framework, making it accessible for experimentation, visualization, and rapid prototyping.

- Reproducible Research:
With all essential components included (datasets, notebooks, and dependency files), the repository is structured to facilitate reproducible research. Users can easily follow the provided instructions to replicate the results or extend the model further.</p>

##  Features

<p> 
- Automated Waste Recognition:
Leverages deep learning techniques to automatically classify different types of waste from images.

- Integrated Datasets:
Comes with compressed datasets (TrashType_Image_Dataset.zip and archive.zip) that provide a diverse collection of waste images for training and evaluation.

- End-to-End Workflow:
The model.ipynb notebook offers a complete pipeline‚Äîfrom data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference‚Äîmaking it easier to understand and reproduce the results.

- Easy Setup and Configuration:
With a dedicated requirements.txt for dependencies and a setup.py for potential packaging or custom installation, the project is designed for quick setup and deployment.

- Reproducible Research:
The repository is structured to support reproducibility, allowing researchers and developers to replicate experiments or extend the model further for various waste management applications.</p>
